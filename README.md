Original README on Myth



Myth: ML Synthesizer


Myth is a type-directed program synthesis tool for ML-like typed, functional programming languages.
Given a set of top-level declarations, a goal type, and a set of examples, Myth produces a program of the appropriate type that satisfies those examples.
